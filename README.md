# CheXpert

Proposed solution and baseline for CheXpert dataset, implemented in PyTorch. CheXpert is a large dataset of chest X-rays and competition for automated chest x-ray interpretation by Stanford ML Group.

The current baseline model has been trained on the low resolution version of the dataset and is based on ideas drawn from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07031.pdf) presented along with the dataset.
